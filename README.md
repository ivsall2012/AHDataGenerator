Frist of all, the name is really bad. I was trying to write a random data generator for [AHPinterest](https://github.com/ivsall2012/AHPinterest) then I just went too far...

This is my first Swift project. And it has a kinda nice transition animation in its photo gallery.
This project helped me built up some experences on custom transitions for later writing AHPinterest.
