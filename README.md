# AHDataGenerator
A transition animation practice

Frist of all, the name is reall bad. I was trying to write a random data generator for [AHPinterest](https://github.com/ivsall2012/AHPinterest) then I just went too far...

This is my first Swift project. And it has a kinda "magical" transition animation for its photo gallery if you haven't learned custom transition before.
This project helped me built up some experences on cusome transitions for later writing AHPinterest.
